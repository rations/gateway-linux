# NAMix

NAMix is a neural amp modeller plugin for Linux. It is based on
[NeuralAmpModelerPlugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin)
by Steven Atkinson and all contributors to the Neural Amp Modeler project.
All original copyright is retained by Steven Atkinson.

iPlug2, the framework used by the original plugin, has no working Linux
backend. NAMix is therefore a **raw VST3** plugin: it is written directly
against the [VST 3 SDK](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk), embeds its
editor into the host window through `IPlugView`, and paints that editor itself
with Cairo and FreeType. There is no plugin framework and no GUI toolkit in the
build, which lets NAMix keep the original project's **MIT licence**.
See [LICENSE](https://github.com/rations/NAMix/blob/master/LICENSE) and
[NOTICE](https://github.com/rations/NAMix/blob/master/NOTICE) for full details.

NAMix ships as two separate binaries:

| Binary | Use |
|---|---|
| `NAMix.vst3` | VST3 plugin — load inside a DAW (REAPER, Ardour, Bitwig, Carla, …) |
| `namix-standalone` | Standalone application — runs without a DAW, connects directly to JACK |

---

## System requirements

NAMix requires **glibc 2.35 or later**. This is present in:

| Distro | Version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | 22.04 LTS or newer |
| Debian | 12 (Bookworm) or newer |
| Devuan | 5 (Daedalus) or newer |
| Fedora | 36 or newer |
| Linux Mint | 21 or newer |
| Pop!_OS | 22.04 or newer |
| MX Linux | 23 or newer |
| Arch Linux | rolling |
| Manjaro | rolling |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | rolling |
| Void | rolling |

Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11 (Bullseye), RHEL/CentOS 9, and openSUSE Leap 15.x
ship glibc 2.31–2.34 and will not load these binaries. Users on those systems
should build from source (see below).

The plugin needs Cairo, FreeType, fontconfig and libX11 at runtime — all are
present on any desktop Linux install. It does **not** link JACK.

The standalone additionally needs the JACK client library (`libjack.so.0`) and
a running JACK server — `sudo apt install jackd2` on Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu, or
`pipewire-jack` on a PipeWire desktop. Both ship the library, so if you already
run JACK you already have it. No `-dev` packages are needed to *run* NAMix;
those are only for building from source.

## Installing the pre-built release

Download the `NAMix-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` asset from the
[latest release](https://github.com/rations/NAMix/releases/latest).

Extract it and enter the directory it creates — the version is part of both
names, so let the shell fill it in:

```bash
tar -xzf NAMix-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd NAMix-*/
```

(If you keep several versions side by side, name the one you want instead of
using the glob.) The directory holds both binaries; install whichever you need.

**VST3 plugin** — copy into your user VST3 folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vst3
cp -r NAMix.vst3 ~/.vst3/
```

The plugin will appear as **NAMix** in any VST3-capable DAW.

**Standalone application** — run it from that same directory, with a JACK
server already running:

```bash
./namix-standalone
```

To uninstall, remove the installed plugin and the directory you extracted:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vst3/NAMix.vst3
```

---

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rations/NAMix.git
cd NAMix
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
```

Required system packages (Debian/Ubuntu):

```
build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config libcairo2-dev libfreetype-dev
libfontconfig-dev libx11-dev libjack-jackd2-dev
```

The VST 3 SDK is included as a submodule. To build against a checkout you
already have, pass `-DVST3_SDK_DIR=/path/to/vst3sdk` instead.

After building, install the VST3:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vst3
cp -r build/VST3/Release/NAMix.vst3 ~/.vst3/
```

Verify the build with Steinberg's validator, which is built alongside it:

```bash
./build/bin/Release/validator build/VST3/Release/NAMix.vst3
```

To render the editor panel to a PNG without a host or an X server — useful for
checking the layout after changing `src/namgeometry.h`:

```bash
./build/panelrender /tmp/panel.png resources
```

To build and package a release archive:

```bash
bash scripts/makedist-linux.sh
```

## Usage

1. Load a `.nam` model file by clicking the **model** row; an in-plugin browser
   opens. The `<` and `>` arrows step through the other models in the same
   folder, and the **✕** clears the current one.
2. Optionally load an impulse response (`.wav`) on the **IR** row the same way.
3. Adjust **Input**, **Output**, and tone-stack knobs (**Bass**, **Middle**,
   **Treble**) by dragging vertically, or with the mouse wheel.
4. The **EQ** toggle enables or disables the tone stack.
5. The **Noise Gate** toggle enables the noise gate; the **Threshold** knob
   sets the gate level.
6. The **⚙** (gear) button opens the settings panel, where you can configure
   the input calibration level and output mode (Raw / Normalized / Calibrated).
   Options the loaded capture does not support are greyed out.
7. If the loaded model supports slimming, a small icon appears to the right of
   the model row. Click it to open the Slim overlay and reduce the model size.

Hosts without a GUI can still load models: the edit controller implements a
small `INamFileLoader` interface, discoverable through `queryInterface`, that
takes model and IR paths directly.
